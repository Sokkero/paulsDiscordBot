# paulsDiscordBot

## Rules for contribution:
1. Indents = Tabs (for VScode I can recommend the 'EditorConfig' extension)
2. There are a few style rules which are all defined by ESLint (checkout the .eslintrc.json file for more information)
3. This bot is exclusively in english
4. Do NOT push any tokens or 'config.json' files 

## Notes and fyi's

-> This project is based on nodeJS

-> 	Before being able to start the bot,
	create a 'config.json' file like this in the root dir:

	{
		"token": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
		"prefix": "YOUR_PREFERED_PREFIX",
		"regExPattern": ".*(?=it)",
		"regExFlags": "g"
	}

-> Also create a 'guildConfigs' folder in the root dir

-> Navigate to the project in your console
```$ cd {your path}/paulsDiscordBot```

-> Initialize the bot
```$ npm install```

-> Start the bot
```$ node .```
